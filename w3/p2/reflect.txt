In this workshop, I learned about specializing of templates and Inheritance and the inclusion of polymorphism. This makes me revise the oop 244 as the main concept is the same the only difference is that there is some advancement for example in the workshop we created the add function as a helper not the member function of the class and we also modify it in part 2. This is because to avoid the repetition of the words and it is defined outside of the class because of specialization of the template that is for the expecption value passed through the template.

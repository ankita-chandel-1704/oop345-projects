This workshop has introduced me to static memory, and as it is totally based on the revision of oop 244, it has had me go through all the
 concepts connected to dynamic memory and pointers. The foodorders.cpp file, where we utilised an internal link to define the static, was used in this workshop, 
and I used both internal and exterior links.
For taxes and discounts, there is a counter and an outside link. The static keyword is utilised when declaring the counter and publishing 
the output since it limits that variable to that function within that scope. The variable is now declared dynamically with the help of pointers, 
as opposed to Part 1, where it was declared to a fixed size.
